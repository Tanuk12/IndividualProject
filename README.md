# Shape Calculator
# by jasper mowdood
This is a calculator for 3d shapes including: Cuboid, prisms, pyramids, cylinder and spheres. It will return both the surface area and volume for the shapes. The user will give the needed information to do the calculations. Ex if you want to do a cuboid it will ask for the length width height and it will return both the surface area and the volume.
